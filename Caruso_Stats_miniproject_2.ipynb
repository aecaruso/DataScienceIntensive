    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "**4)** Given data on resumes randomly labeled with a race as 'w' or 'b' the statistical significance of the impact of race on the likelihood of getting a call back was investigated. This was done by looking at the difference in mean proportion of callbacks for the 'w' group and the 'b' group. Our null hypothesis was that the difference in means is 0, meaning there is no impact of race. The alternative hypothesis is that the difference in means is not 0, showing that race does have an impact. I did my calculations with a 5% margin of error meaning that I am willing to risk a Type I error 5% of the time. Another way to put this is that my significance level is 5%, so I am looking to see if the results of the study described here are more extreme than a critical value encompassing 95% of data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. What I found is that my sample difference in means is 0.0320 and the sampling distribution of difference in means (assumed to have a mean value of 0) has a std of 0.00778 (the calculations are described above). Using a two tailed z-test with 5% significance my critical z-value is found to be 1.96. This means that it should be expected that 95% of sample difference in means should lie within 1.96 standard deviations of 0. However, my sample difference in means sits at 4.114 standard deviations from 0. The likelihood the difference in means observed from this sample sitting at such an extreme value happening by chance is very low, with a P-value of almost 0. This means that the observed difference in means is not a fluke. Because of this, **I will reject the null hypothesis and will accept the hypothesis that the label of race does have an impact on the likelihood of getting a call back on a resume.**"

    "**5)** It is true that the data shows that there is a statistically significant correlation between race and the likelihood of getting a call back, but there are many more factors that could be affecting these results. Race is only one parameter of the many that are listed in the data set. It is possible that race is the most noteable factor, however we cannot know this until we test all of the other reasonable factors. One important factor to look at is the level of education, because most jobs have minimum education requirements. If I were to ammend my analysis I would start by looking individually at race, years of education, and number of previous jobs. After the individual analysis I would combine resume information to look at how education affected the outcome given their race, etc."

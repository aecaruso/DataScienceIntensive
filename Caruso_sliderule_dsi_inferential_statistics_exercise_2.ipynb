    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

The alternative hypothesis is that the difference in means is not 0, showing that race does have an impact. I did my calculations with a 5% margin of error meaning that I am willing to risk a Type I error 5% of the time.

    "    The likelihood the difference in means observed from this sample sitting at such an extreme value happening by chance is very low, with a P-value of almost 0. This means that the observed difference in means is not a fluke. Because of this, I will reject the null hypothesis and will accept the hypothesis that the label of race does have an impact on the likelihood of getting a call back on a resume."

    "5) It is true that the data shows that there is a statistically significant correlation between race and the likelihood of getting a call back, but there are many more factors that could be affecting these results. Race is only one parameter of the many that are listed in the data set. It is possible that race is the most noteable factor, however we cannot know this until we test all of the other reasonable factors. One important factor to look at is the level of education, because most jobs have minimum education requirements. If I were to ammend my analysis I would start by looking individually at race, years of education, and number of previous jobs. After the individual analysis I would combine resume information to look at how education affected the outcome given their race, etc."
